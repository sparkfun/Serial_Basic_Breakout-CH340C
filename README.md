[*SparkFun Serial Basic Breakout - CH340C (DEV-15096)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15096)

This is a CH340C based board that converts USB to Serial. We've added USB-C to
the Serial Basic line which can provide up to 1.5 Amps of power to your next
project. USB-C is also _reversable_, which means you'll never plug in a cable
wrong again. It follows the standard Arduino pin out so this can be used to program the Pro 
and Pro Mini line of Arduinos.  It can also be used as a general serial device for debugging 
(such as with a GPS module).

Board defaults to 3.3V output and 3.3V serial signals, but cutting the trace on the underside of the board and 
soldering a jumper to 5V changes the VCC pin to output 5V and changes serial comm signals to 5V.
