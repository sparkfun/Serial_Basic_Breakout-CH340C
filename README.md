[*SparkFun Serial Basic Breakout - CH340C (DEV-14050)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14050)

This is a CH340C based board that converts USB to Serial. 
It follows the standard Arduino pin out so this can be used to program the Pro and Pro Mini line of Arduinos. 
It can also be used as a general serial device for debugging (such as with a GPS module).

Board is default 3.3V output and 3.3V serial signals but cutting the trace on the back of the board and 
soldering a jumper to 5V changes the VCC pin to output 5V and changes serial comm signals to 5V.
